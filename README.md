# Real-time Pill Counting using Computer Vision

Pill counting is one of indispensable steps of distributing medicine in medical facilities. Generally, pills are counted manually and this counting method takes a lot of time for pharmacists and patients.  Nowadays, thanks to its high precision and convenience, computer vision application is very popular, many applications are studied and invented incessantly and they play an important role in a host of automatic systems in a variety of fields. These systems provide contactless control which eliminates the influence of human factors, reduces errors. As a result, the measurement will give faster results with higher accuracy. In this project, we propose a real-time computer vision program in order to count the number of pills via video captured by a removable camera connected to the computer. Our program is based on Otsu's threshold method and the image segmentation of Watershed transformation which can count pills without considering other factors such as shape and size. We believe that this is a great tool to save time and increase accuracy for counting tablets, improving the productivity of pharmacists’ works and saving patients’ time. <p
